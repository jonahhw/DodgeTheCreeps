Tutorial that I followed created by GDQuest, and original tutorial is part of the Godot documentation (located [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html), with Git repo [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/tree/master/getting_started/first_2d_game))

This is a simple tutorial game, uploaded mostly so that I can learn how to use Git with Godot, as well as learn a few other Git features. I may also continue to add features to the game; so far the only major things that I've changed is that mobs now spawn off screen , and mob movement and spawning is synced to the music.
